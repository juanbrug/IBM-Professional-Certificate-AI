## Capstone project: Comparison and evaluation of pretrained models for concrete crack detection

Crack detection is important for structural health monitoring and inspections. A classifier using
pretrained models is built to detect cracks in images of concrete. Images of cracked concrete are
denoted as the positive class and images of concrete without cracks as the negative class.

In this capstone project, an image classifier using the VGG16 pre-trained model is
evaluated and compared in performance to a classifier using the ResNet50 pre-trained model.
